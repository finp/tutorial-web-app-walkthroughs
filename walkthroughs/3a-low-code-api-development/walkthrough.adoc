= {walkthrough}

This walkthrough demonstrates how to implement a container-native OpenAPI RESTful API without coding.

Container-native applications::
Applications that are designed to run in a containerised environment.

// This is taken right from https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification
OpenAPI Specification::
A standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for REST APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.

In this walkthrough you follow a design-first approach, based on the OpenAPI specification, to define a RESTful API that accepts a name parameter and echoes it back in the response body. 
You then use the resulting Open API definition to generate the code for your API and deploy it in a containerised environment.

Following a design first approach to API development is self-documenting, and provides a clear API definition for partners and end-users of your API.
It also allows you to identify important design decisions prior to coding and deployment.

== Exposing and invoking the API

=== API Management Login

. Open the link:{api-management-url}[{3scale-name} Login screen, window="_blank"].

. Select the *Red Hat Single Sign On* option. This triggers an OAuth Flow and redirects you back to the {3scale-name} Dashboard.

. Dismiss the *How does 3Scale work?* option which is displayed the first time you log in to {3scale-name}. The main Dashboard is displayed.

[type=verification]
Can you see the {3scale-name} Dashboard and navigate the main menu?

[type=verificationFail]
Verify that you followed each step in the procedure above.  If you are still having issues, contact your administrator.


=== Adding the App Endpoint to Red Hat 3scale

. From the *Dashboard*, select the *New API* item.
. Select the *Import from OpenShift* option.
If this option is not enabled, click *authenticate with OpenShift* to enable the option.

. Choose the 'fuse' option from the *Namespace* list.
. Choose 'i-greeting-api' from the *Name* list.
. Click *Create Service*.
+
This process can take a few minutes.

. Edit the API Service:

.. From the top navigation bar click the dropdown and choose your 'i-greeting-api'

.. From the *Overview* screen, select the *Configure APIcast* button.

.. In the *Staging Public Base URL*, enter:
+
[subs="attributes+"]
----
https://wt-{user-sanitized-username}-3scale.{openshift-app-host}
----
+
If the wildcard proxy is enabled in your cluster, this route points to the wildcard APIcast URL. Otherwise, the route points to the shared staging APIcast URL for the *3scale* project in OpenShift

.. In the *MAPPING RULES* section, add a *POST* mapping with the pattern `/greeting`.

.. Select *Update & test in Staging Environment*
+
[NOTE]
====
If you have previously used the ```https://wt-{user-sanitized-username}-3scale.{openshift-app-host}``` route, that service is no longer available.
For example, if you have completed the *Managing and protecting APIs using API management* walkthrough, that API is no longer available because you have reused the route.
====

. Expand the *Mapping Rules* section and click the pencil icon to edit the default entry.

.. Change *Verb* to *POST* and *Pattern* to */greeting*.

.. Scroll down to the *Client* section. This section enables 3scale to test connectivity to our API via the gateway. Since our API does not expose a *GET* endpoint we won't be using it, but note that the *user_key* is this section is currently not set to an actual value. To fix this we need to create an *Application Plan* for our *API Service* and an *Application*.

.. Click *Update & test in Staging Environment* to save your changes.


. Create An Application Plan

.. Click *Overview* to return to the overview screen for your API.

.. Click *Create Application Plan* in the *Published Application Plans* section.

.. Enter the following name:
+
----
Greeting API Application Plan
----

Enter the following system name:
+
----
greeting-app-plan
----

.. Ensure the *Applications require approval?* box is not ticked, then click *Create Application Plan*.


. Create an Application

.. Navigate to *Audience* using the dropdown in the top navigation bar.

.. Choose *Developer* from the account listing.

.. In the breadcrumb bar click *$NUMBER Application* link next to your account name to view applications.

.. Click *Create Application* at the top of the displayed list.

.. On the *New Application* screen choose your *Greeting API Application Plan* in the *Application Plan* dropdown.

.. Enter the following name:
+
----
Greeting Application
----

Enter the following description:
+
----
Greeting Application that sends greetings to Slack
----

=== Invoking the API

.. From your new *Greeting Application* screen click the *i-greeting-api* next to Service.

.. From the *Overview* screen click *Configuration* and choose *edit APIcast configuration* on the displayed *Configuration* page.

.. Scroll down and note that the *user_key* parameter is now set.

.. Using the URL we can execute a cURL request from a terminal with the command below. You can use a tool such as Postman if you prefer. Make sure you replace *$YOUR_KEY* with the key displayed in 3scale:
+
----

curl -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' --data '{"name":"{user-sanitized-username}"}' "https://wt-{user-sanitized-username}-3scale.{openshift-app-host}/greeting?user_key=$YOUR_KEY"
